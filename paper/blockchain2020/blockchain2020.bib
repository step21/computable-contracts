A smart contract is executable code that runs on top of the blockchain to facilitate, execute and enforce an agreement between untrusted parties without the involvement of a trusted third party. In this paper, we conduct a systematic mapping study to collect all research that is relevant to smart contracts from a technical perspective. The aim of doing so is to identify current research topics and open challenges for future studies in smart contract research. We extract 24 papers from different scientific databases. The results show that about two thirds of the papers focus on identifying and tackling smart contract issues. Four key issues are identified, namely, codifying, security, privacy and performance issues. The rest of the papers focuses on smart contract applications or other smart contract related topics. Research gaps that need to be addressed in future studies are provided.},

  abstract = {This article explores `smart contracts' from first principles: What they are, whether they are properly called `contracts', and what issues they raise for national contract law. A `smart' contract purports to record contractual promises in language which is both intelligible to human beings and (ultimately) executable by machines. The formalisation of contracting language that this entails is, I argue, the most important aspect for lawyers\textemdash just as important as the automation of contractual performance. Rather than taking a doctrinal approach focused on the presence of traditional indicia of contract formation, I examine the nature of contracts as legal entities created by words and documents. In most cases, smart contracts will be `wrapped in paper' and nested in a national legal system. Borrowing from the idiom of computer science, I introduce the term `contract stack' to highlight the complex nature of contracts as legal entities incorporating different `layers', including speech acts by the parties in both natural and formal languages as well as mandatory legal rules. It is the interactions within this contract stack that will be most important to the development of contract law doctrines appropriate to smart contracts. To illustrate my points, I explore a few issues that smart contracts might raise for English contract law. I touch on the questions of illegality, jurisdiction, and evidence, but my focus in this paper is on exploring issues in contract law proper. This contribution should be helpful not only to lawyers attempting to understand smart contracts, but to those involved in coding smart contracts\textemdash and writing the languages used to code them.},

  abstract = {The pervasiveness of IoT devices makes the delivery mechanism of security updates a challenge. Current IoT systems rely on centralized or brokered paradigms or clouds with huge computational and storage capacities. The existing centralized IoT setups are therefore expensive as the result of factors such as the high costs associated with cloud server and network infrastructures and maintenance. Thus, the need for a fully decentralized peer to peer and secure technology to overcome these problems rises into the realm of existence. Blockchain provides a solution that fulfills the requirements of such a platform. Ideally, the update infrastructure should implement the CIA triad properties (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability). In this article, we study how a blockchain application can meet these requirements and propose a novel system to decentrally distribute digital content in a peer-to-peer network using the blockchain technology and smart contracts to overcome the concerns mentioned above. Additionally, in order to prevent the issues stemming from the free-riding challenge in P2P networks (peers refrain to generously share their resources to distribute updates), we exploit a Nash equilibrium micropayment mechanism to grant adequate incentive for peers to participate in distributing IoT update files.},

We study this problem in Ethereum, the most well-known and used framework for smart contracts so far. We analyse the security vulnerabilities of Ethereum smart contracts, providing a taxonomy of common programming pitfalls which may lead to vulnerabilities. We show a series of attacks which exploit these vulnerabilities, allowing an adversary to steal money or cause other damage.},

More particularly, regulation increases the chain's interdependencies and can promote the formation of networks as devices due to foster monitoring over standard compliance. The Chapter provides for a comparative analysis of certification schemes in food and non-food sectors, in order to present possible forms of correlation between the type of regulation and the shape of regulatory networks. As part of a more comprehensive design of contractual governance along the chain, these networks may combine hierarchical and responsive devices in order to attain effective compliance well beyond the mainstream paths of conventional contract theory.},

Some of the revised papers presented in this book originate from a workshop held at the European University Institute of Florence, Italy, in December 2006. The workshop was devoted to the discussion of the different ways of understanding and explaining contemporary law, for the purpose of building computable models of it -- especially models enabling the development of computer applications for the legal domain. During the course of the following year, several new contributions, provided by a number of ongoing (or recently finished) European projects on computation and law, were received, discussed and reviewed to complete the survey. 
 
This book presents 20 thoroughly refereed revised papers on the hot topics under research in different EU projects: legislative XML, legal ontologies, semantic web, search and meta-search engines, web services, system architecture, dialectic systems, dialogue games, multi-agent systems (MAS), legal argumentation, legal reasoning, e-justice, and online dispute resolution. The papers are organized in topical sections on knowledge representation, ontologies and XML legislative drafting; knowledge representation, legal ontologies and information retrieval; argumentation and legal reasoning; normative and multi-agent systems; and online dispute resolution.},

  abstract = {In conventional transactions, written contracts usually memorialize the terms of the commercial exchange. For deals in which some of the goods being transferred and the forum for the trade are digitized \textemdash{} as in the case of cryptocurrencies \textemdash{} parties may use computer code rather than a written contract to record their terms. Such pieces of code are sometimes called ``smart contracts'' because they perform many of the same functions as contracts but are expressed in a computing language. Coded exchanges embody a potentially revolutionary contracting innovation. But they are difficult to assimilate into traditional contracting terminology, conceptual framing, and doctrine. This Article begins by distilling the central legally and practically significant type of smart contracts \textemdash{} what we call ``transactional scripts.'' It then develops an account of how these scripts, which operate on public blockchains, are created, the economic barriers to their adoption, and how they produce errors of legal significance. This account, in turn, allows us to more rigorously and accessibly situate transactional scripts in existing legal doctrine.Commentators are enthusiastic about scripts in part because, the story goes, they are ``self-executing'' and require no third-party adjudicators. Yet we show that optimism to be unfounded by documenting how scripts, like ordinary contracts, can result in misunderstanding, frustrated intent, and failure. When code misdelivers, disappointed parties will seek legal recourse. We argue that jurists should situate scripts within other legally operative statements and disclosures, or contract stacks. Precision about the relationship between script and stack sustains a novel framework, rooted in old doctrines of interpretation, parol evidence and equity, that will help jurists compile answers to the private law problems that digitized exchange entails.},

The technology permits people to directly exchange money for what they want, with no intermediaries, such as credit card companies. Contract law is the law of bargained-for exchange, so a technology that enables direct exchange online will change the reality of online contracting. The current problem with consumer contracting online is that courts and companies have collaborated to create an online system in which consumers cannot bargain. Under the current regime, consumers have no choice but to click the ``I Accept'' button. Online, contract law is not the law of bargained-for exchange; it has become the law of company-dictated exchange. Smart contracts\textemdash automated computer programs able to execute trades through TPLs\textemdash may offer a solution.

These routines may be influenced by community-developed open data standards to explicate, analyze, and report OSS risks. Open data standards are co-created in open communities for unifying the exchange of information. The SPDX\textregistered{} specification is such an open data standard to explicate and share OSS risk information. The development and subsequent adoption of SPDX raises the questions of how organizations make sense of SPDX when improving their own risk management routines, and of how a community benefits from the experiential knowledge that is contributed back by organizational adopters. To explore these questions, we conducted a single case, multi-component field study, connecting with members of organizations that employed SPDX. The results of this study contribute to understanding the development and adoption of open data standards within open source environments.},

We are finding that these assumptions are no longer valid. Corporate members' participation in open source software development and greater attention to compliance with open source licenses has signalled the need for new metaphors for open source software design and development. In this study, we use participant observation and functional discourse analysis to determine which metaphors are useful and seek evidence for these metaphors in the emergent governance structure of the Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX\textregistered ) working group, which is one of the important players in the future of open source development. We observed three governing structures for the SPDX working group: meritocracy, adhocracy, and family/republic and reflected back to the SPDX working group the need to pay greater attention to their governance structures to help in future strategic decisions. We conclude that open source developers now have a choice among collectivism, creativity, competition, and control.},

  abstract = {Commercial law ideally seeks to reduce opportunism\textemdash conduct that attempts to reallocate risks that were implicitly or explicitly assigned by the contract. But efforts to regulate opportunism confront serious limitations. Legal doctrines aimed at such conduct may reduce one form of opportunism, but simultaneously create risks of alternative forms. Arbiters of commercial disputes who seek to constrain misconduct in a specific case may have difficulty distinguishing between opportunism and behaviour that is consistent with contractually created entitlements to take advantage of changed circumstances. Consequently, reduction of commercial opportunism may perhaps best be achieved by reliance on contractual clauses and reputation. Examination of contracts negotiated in circumstances that expose one party to the risk of hold-up reveals that parties incur significant drafting costs in order to reduce incentives for opportunism. Courts and other arbiters would advance efforts to minimize strategic behaviour by enforcing such clauses, notwithstanding doctrinal limitations on their validity.},

  abstract = {Contract today increasingly links entrepreneurial innovations to the efforts and finance necessary to transform ideas into value. This chapter describes the match between a form of contract that `braids' formal and informal contractual elements in novel ways and the process by which innovation is pursued. It is hardly surprising that these innovative forms of contract have emerged first in markets, and that the common law, and the theory of contract, then play catch-up. Between the time contracting practice adapts to the demands of innovation and the time contract doctrine adapts to the demands of practice, law acts as a friction on the innovation process rather than a lubricant to it. The goal here is to reduce that lag by providing a theory that can guide courts in developing case law that addresses current forms of innovation.},

It allows developers to create smart contracts - small computer programs that sit on the blockchain. These programs can be written in programming languages like solidity and are executed by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Since Ethereum is a public blockchain, all the data of the blockchain is available publicly. However, getting smart contract data is a tedious process and public data-sets for smart contracts are not available for further analysis. Therefore, in this work, we collect a total of 1.9M smart contracts till the block height of 7.1M, and provide a first of its kind analysis across different parameters like duplicity, ether balance, ether moved, etc. We observe that across all these different parameters, only a small fraction of the smart contracts are dominant. We label such 2900 dominant contracts as the `Contracts of Importance' and use it for further analysis using the various tools available to give us an insight into the vulnerability trends and patterns in smart contracts.},

  abstract = {Berkeley Electronic Press Selected Works, This article argues that to achieve a technology neutral law, technology specific law is sometimes required. To explain this we discriminate between three objectives, often implied in the literature on technological neutrality of law. The first we call the compensation objective, which refers to the need to have technology specific law in place whenever specific technological designs threated the substance of human rights. The second we call the innovation objective, referring to the need to prevent legal rules from privileging or discriminating specific technological designs in ways that would stifle innovation. The third we call the sustainability objective, which refers to the need to enact legislation at the right level of abstraction, to prevent the law from becoming out of date all too soon. The argument that technology neutral law requires compensation in the form of technology specific law is built on a relational conception of technology, and we explain that though technology in itself is neither good nor bad, it is never neutral. We illustrate the relevance of the three objectives with a discussion of the EU cookie Directive of 2009. Finally we explain the salience of the legal obligation of Data Protection by Design in the proposed General Data Protection Regulation and test this against the compensation, innovation and sustainability objectives.},

To investigate these questions the book brings together two disciplinary perspectives rarely combined within the framework of one volume. One starts from the perspective of `code and law' and the other develops from the domain of `law and literature'. Integrating original analyses of relevant novels or films, the authors discuss how computational technologies challenge traditional forms of legal thought and affect the regulation of human behavior.

  abstract = {Berkeley Electronic Press Selected Works, Control at a distance (cybernetics) has been one of the achievements of modern law. Since the advent of the printing press, written law has been instrumental for those in power to rule over a large jurisdiction with a great many subjects: enabling sovereign power to rule by law. Moving from absolutism to the rule of law basically meant that law gained a measure of autonomy between ruler and subjects, still providing the means to govern but also providing individual citizens with legal instruments to resist those in charge. This chapter argues that both the rule by law and the rule of law have been an affordance of the printing press, extending the distantiations in time and space already inherent in the script, thus exponentially reinforcing the need for interpretation and the related delays and hesitations that precede the application of law in court. Looking into the novel communication infrastructures we can observe a shift from the linear sequential thought processes particular to the age of the printing press to the parallel processing typical for the era of real time computing. We argue that this shift enlarges the scope for virtualisation (computer mediated real time modelling and simulation), but simultaneously collapses the distantiations implied in the logic of the script, washing away the need for reflection that is preconditional for critical reasoning as well as for a the fair trial. Speed and instantaneity are replacing delay and distance as pertinent features of communication. We then argue that lawyers must urgently align with computer scientists to advise the legislator on how to redesign the emerging socio-technical infrastructure in a way that affords the central tenets of constitutional democracy. Building on the concept of Ambient Law this means that the democratic legislator must become involved in articulating the necessary safeguards into the socio-technical infrastructure these safeguards aim to protect against.},

  abstract = {Berkeley Electronic Press Selected Works, To cope with an increasingly proactive technological infrastructure a so-called vision of Ambient Law has been developed. It entails the articulation of legal protection into the ICT architecture, to safeguard our rights and freedoms within the various cyberspaces we inhabit. I will argue that the Internet of Things and Ambient Intelligence generate novel challenges to the rights to privacy, due process and non-discrimination, warranting effective remedies beyond the written law. The vision of Ambient Law builds on similar notions within the domain of ethics of technology (e.g. privacy by design, privacy by default, value-sensitive design). Expanding on previous publications this contribution engages with three possible objections to the idea of legal protection by design. Firstly, one could object that legal protection should be technology-neutral, meaning that regulators should avoid technology dependence when formulating legal norms. This could imply that legal protection cannot be part of a technological design. Second, one might equate this approach with taking a command-and-control perspective, assuming that the intervention of the democratic legislator engages a top down perspective, compared to e.g. public-private collaboration. Third, one might equate the idea of Ambient Law with techno-regulation, or technological enforcement of administrative law. I will argue that all three objections misconstrue the notion of Ambient Law, and miss the point that law-as-we-know-it is already technologically embodied. The conclusion will be that when we move from the technologies of the script to those of mobile interconnected digital computer systems, effective legal protection requires creative re-enactment into the novel infrastructures.},

  author = {Hildebrandt, Mireille},
  year = {2010},
  abstract = {Berkeley Electronic Press Selected Works, Positive law, inscribed in legal texts, entails an authority not inherent in literary texts, generating legal consequences that can have real effects on a person's life and liberty. The interpretation of legal texts, necessarily a normative undertaking, resists the mechanical application of rules, though still requiring a measure of predictability, coherence with other relevant legal norms and compliance with constitutional safeguards. The present proliferation of legal texts on the internet (codes, statutes, judgments, treaties, doctrinal treatises) renders the selection of relevant texts and cases next to impossible. We may expect that systems to mine these texts to find arguments that support one's case, as well as expert systems that support the decision-making process of courts, will end up doing much of the work. This raises the question of the difference between human interpretation and computational pattern-recognition and the issue of whether this difference makes a difference for the meaning of law. Possibly, data mining will produce patterns that disclose habits of the minds of judges and legislators that would have otherwise gone unnoticed (reinforcing the argument of the `legal realists' at the beginning of the 20th century). Also, after the data analysis it will still be up to the judge to decide how to interpret the results or up to the prosecution which patterns to engage in the construction of evidence (requiring a hermeneutics of computational patterns instead of texts). My focus in this paper regards the fact that the mining process necessarily disambiguates the legal texts in order to transform them into a machine-readable data set, while the algorithms used for the analysis embody a strategy that will co-determine the outcome of the patterns. There seems a major due process concern here to the extent that these patterns are invisible for the naked human eye and will not be contestable in a court of law, due to their hidden complexity and computational nature. This position paper aims to explain what is at stake in the computational turn with regard to legal texts. This prepares for the question I want to put forward to those involved in distant reading and not-reading of texts: could a visualization of computational patterns constitute a new way of un-hiding the complexity involved, opening the results of computational `knowledge' to citizens' scrutiny?},

This contribution builds on the findings of my chapter concerning Radbruch's inquiry into the origins of the criminal law, in Foundational Texts in Modern Criminal Law. In that chapter I present the rise of the sovereign state as a precondition for a Rule of Law that institutes a balancing act between the different powers of the state. In the current article I briefly present the rise of the Rule of Law in the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, exemplified by the rise of the German Rechtsstaat, the French \'Etat de Droit and the Anglo-American Rule of Law. This provides the background for a discussion of the contribution that Radbruch's antinomian concept of law can make to a better understanding of the difference between legalism and legality. I argue that a mistaken view on legality informs the prevalent confusion around the notion of the Rule of Law. The investigation is complemented with the introduction of a procedural conception of both law and the Rule of Law, taking the discussion beyond formal and substantial conceptions of both. Finally, I integrate an analysis of Schmitt's keen attention to the institution of law, observing that legalism and legality align with different institutionalizations, different legal orders and different modes of existence of law and the Rule of Law.},

  author = {Hildebrandt, Mireille},
  year = {2009},
  abstract = {Berkeley Electronic Press Selected Works, In her humourous and painfull descriptions of the lives of (former) Yugoslavians, Dubravna Ugresic keenly demonstrates the intimate connection between humans and things. Like Paul Auster in The invention of solitude, she traces the unexpected workings of our 'capricious' memory (MUS:77) and its attachment to things that take us back to other times or other places (watches, houses, photographs, bridges). Written from the perspective of an exile her the Museum of Unconditional Surrender exhibits the nomadic sense of belonging that is evoked by things that may seem trivial from an 'objective' perspective. The experience of the destruction of the most robust things that constitute the world, as described by Ugresic, adequately demonstrates how our sense of self emerges from our continuous interaction with the things that co-produce our world. And to what extent this sense of self is thus built on quicksands that are ready to take us in at any moment in time (war, earthquakes, tsunami's). In this paper I will argue that Ugresic demonstrates that we are detectable in our dealings with the things that surround us, rather than in our deepest thoughts about ourselves, while at the same time the meaning of these things depends on our dealings with them. In the preface to the Museum of Unconditional Surrender, after describing the unusual display of the contents of the stomach of Roland the walrus in the Berlin Zoo, she writes: 'The chapters and fragments which follow should be read in a similar way. If the reader feels that there are no meaningful or firm connections between them, let him be patient: the connections will establish themselves of their own accord. And one more thing: the question as to whether this novel is autobiographical might at some hypothetical moment be of concern to the police, but not to the reader'. The fragmented narratives that follow her preface nourish the reader with an abundance of seemingly disconnected little stories that in fact often resist the basic requirements of a story (no beginning, no end, no plot, no significant action). But somehow the reader that stomachs all this, learns to trace the human imbroglio's that emerge from these strange collections of momentary dealings in a devastated world. The reader begins to profile the persons that emerge from the heap of disjointed memories that she is presented with. And it may be the case that from this heap of ruptured enaction a stronger image is concocted of the humans that people this book, than any type of deliberate reflection could have produced. Behavioural biometric profiling technologies, which build on the correlations between a host of trivial interactions between people and things, may likewise produce a type of knowledge that is more precise, more fuzzy and more intimate than any compilation of sensitive personal data could be. These dynamic profiles, inferred from the interactions with our environments, will impact our sense of self. They will supply service providers and government authorities with new insights into our anticipated behaviour and allow them to base their decisions on this anticipation. On the basis of this new type of knowledge they may either deprive us of or provide us with certain opportunities or risks. Perhaps art and literature can alert us to the way these technologies will create a new type of knowledge that may disturb the power balances between individual citizens and large organisations (whether private or public). We may need to rethink the principles that embody these checks and balances: such as privacy, fairness and due process.},

  year = {2009},
  abstract = {Berkeley Electronic Press Selected Works, In this chapter we will argue that if we do not embody legal norms in new techno-logical devices and infrastructures, we may reach the end of law. At the same time we will argue that if we do embody legal norms in technological devices we may still reach the end of the rule of law. In short, first, we argue that legal normativity in an information society needs translation into new technological devices to sus-tain the instrumental and protective normativity that is central to constitutional democracy, and second, we also argue that an unreflective translation of legal standards into technological artefacts is dangerous if technology is wrongly seen as only instrumental to human intention. To argue our point, we will use the example of an emerging technological infrastructure that will probably have far\textendash reaching implications: the so\textendash called `In-ternet of Things', or `Ambient Intelligent Environment'. These implications con-cern the way we perceive things, the way we are present in this world, and the way we can live together with things and human beings (section 2). Instead of building only on schools of thought within law and legal theory, we will analyse the poten-tial consequences with the help of the philosophy of technology. Beyond na\"ive op-timism and ideological pessimism, the philosophy of technology has developed insightful ways to investigate the actual implications of specific technological de-vices and to speculate about what this means for our shared world (section 3). We will draw on, amongst others, the phenomenological inquiries of Don Ihde and the anthropological observations of Bruno Latour, and on the critical reconstruction of their work by Peter\textendash Paul Verbeek. Verbeek provides a critical link to legal norma-tivity, because he assesses the morality of things. This in itself is enough to raise the eyebrows of many a reader, since modernity has taught us that things can only be instruments, while human beings \textendash{} as Kant stipulated \textendash{} should never be treated as pure instruments but always be respected as autonomous creatures. We hope that the reader will bear with us when we discuss the `Internet of Things' in some detail, and explain how a philosophy of technology can enhance our understanding of the implications of this emerging technological infrastruc-ture. After this exploration beyond the limits of the law we will return to the legal field to investigate what legal normativity amounts to and how it compares to technological normativity (section 4). We will explain how both law and technol-ogy can be constitutive or regulative of human (and non\textendash human) interaction, seek-ing to discern relevant similarities and differences. Serious investigation into the normativity of modern law, however, clarifies that contemporary law in Western societies is already technologically embodied, and we will describe the material embodiment of legal norms in written language and the consequences of the use of written language and written law for legal normativity (section 5). Finally, we will discuss the end of law from the two perspectives mentioned above (section 6). Firstly, we will argue that if we do not embody law into new technologies, the emergence of `Ambient Intelligence' and the `Internet of Things' will mean the end of law as an effective and legitimate instrument for constitu-tional democracy. Secondly, we will argue that this cannot mean that legal norms can be embodied in whatever way in any kind of technological device or infra-structure. We will relate a relational conception of law to a pluralist conception of technology and submit that both lawyers and technologists should stop taking for granted deterministic, causal conceptions of technology and voluntaristic concep-tions of law. Only in that case can we continue the process of reconstituting our shared world with a technologically embodied law that adequately installs and protects constitutional democracy.},

  abstract = {Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) promotes software reuse and distribution at different levels for both creator and users, but at the same time imposes some challenges in terms of FOSS licenses that can be selected and combined. The main problem linked to this selection is the presence of a large set of licenses that define different rights and obligations in software use. The problem becomes more evident in cases of complex combinations of software that carries different \textendash{} often conflicting \textendash{} licenses. In this paper we are presenting our work on automating license compatibility by proposing a process that examines the structure of Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX) for license compatibility issues assisting in their correct use and combination. We are offering the possibility to detect license violations in existing software projects and make suggestions on appropriate combinations of different software packages. We are also elaborating on the complexity and ambiguity of licensing detection in software products through representative case studies. Our work constitutes a useful process towards automating the analysis of software systems in terms of license use and compatibilities.},

The contribution of this work includes (1) discussion of MLIR as a research artifact, built for extension and evolution, and identifying the challenges and opportunities posed by this novel design point in design, semantics, optimization specification, system, and engineering. (2) evaluation of MLIR as a generalized infrastructure that reduces the cost of building compilers-describing diverse use-cases to show research and educational opportunities for future programming languages, compilers, execution environments, and computer architecture.

  abstract = {Natural language is one of the most important means of human communication. It enables us to express our will, to exchange thoughts and to document our knowledge in written sources. Owing to its substantial role in many facets of human life, technology for automatically analyzing and processing natural language has recently become increasingly important. In fact, natural language processing tools have paved the way for entirely new business opportunities.The goal of this book is to facilitate the automatic analysis of natural language in process models and to employ this analysis for assisting process model stakeholders. Therefore, a technique is defined that automatically recognizes and annotates process model element labels. In addition, this technique is leveraged to support organizations in effectively utilizing their process models in various ways.The book is organized into seven chapters. It starts with an overview of business process management and linguistics and continues with conceptual contributions on parsing and annotating process model elements, with the detection and correction of process model guideline violations, with the generation of natural language from process models and finally ends with the derivation of service candidates from process models.},

  abstract = {The rise of smart contract systems such as Ethereum has resulted in a proliferation of blockchain-based decentralized applications including applications that store and manage a wide range of data. Current smart contracts are designed to be executed solely by miners and are revealed entirely on-chain, resulting in reduced scalability and privacy. In this paper, we discuss that scalability and privacy of smart contracts can be enhanced by splitting a given contract into an off-chain contract and an on-chain contract. Specifically, functions of the contract that involve high-cost computation or sensitive information can be split and included as the off-chain contract, that is signed and executed by only the interested participants. The proposed approach allows the participants to reach unanimous agreement off-chain when all of them are honest, allowing computing resources of miners to be saved and content of the off-chain contract to be hidden from the public. In case of a dispute caused by any dishonest participants, a signed copy of the off-chain contract can be revealed so that a verified instance can be created to make miners enforce the true execution result. Thus, honest participants have the ability to redress and penalize any fraudulent or dishonest behavior, which incentivizes all participants to honestly follow the agreed off-chain contract. We discuss techniques for splitting a contract into a pair of on/off-chain contracts and propose a mechanism to address the challenges of handling dishonest participants in the system. Our implementation and evaluation of the proposed approach using an example smart contract demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in Ethereum.},

  abstract = {This chapter sketches some important features of the general working mechanisms of fairness and reciprocity and their implications for contract governance. Compared to homo oeconomicus, cooperation is both easier and more difficult with homo reciprocans. Reciprocity repays cooperation with cooperation, but selfish motivations and unconscious biases often lead to an extent of opportunistic behaviour sufficient to trigger a downward spiral driven by negative reciprocity, excess punishment, and anti-social punishment. To check these negative tendencies it is vital to provide the social or moral incentives necessary to sustain positive reciprocity. Since fairness judgments are psychologically indeterminate, cooperation based on reciprocity also implies a need to settle on shared fairness standards. This necessity creates a higher-order coordination problem, which institutions must help to solve. In short, contract governance has to tame and institutionalize sanctions and to coordinate fairness standards via the expressive dimension of norms and contracts.},

This chapter examines, using a three-perspective comparative analysis, to which extent the European Commission by bringing forward these proposals has actually moved away from the pCESL project and started again and, if it has done so, whether these proposals as they currently stand form an adequate replacement for the rebirth of a truly digital European Contract Law.},

However, none of the two alternatives can individually provide the services and quality of services (QoS) imposed on smart contracts involved in a large class of applications. The reason is that blockchain platforms suffer from scalability, performance, transaction costs and other limitations. Likewise, off-blockchain platforms are afflicted by drawbacks emerging from their dependence on single trusted third parties. We argue that in several applications, hybrid platforms composed from the integration of on and off-blockchain platforms are more adequate. Developers that informatively choose between the three alternatives are likely to implement smart contracts that deliver the expected QoS. Hybrid architectures are largely unexplored. To help cover the gap and as a proof of concept, in this paper we discuss the implementation of smart contracts on hybrid architectures. We show how a smart contract can be split and executed partially on an off-blockchain contract compliance checker and partially on the rinkeby ethereum network. To test the solution, we expose it to sequences of contractual operations generated mechanically by a contract validator tool.},

  abstract = {Corruption is a major global financial problem with billions of dollars rendered lost or unaccountable annually. Corruption through contract fraud is often conducted by withholding and/or altering financial information. When such scandals are investigated by authorities, financial and legal documents are usually altered to conceal the paper trail. Smart contracts have emerged in recent years and appear promising for applications such as legal contracts where transparency is critical and of public interest. Transparency and auditability are inherent because smart contracts execute operations on the blockchain, a distributed public ledger. In this paper, we propose the Minimum Hybrid Contract (MHC), with the aim of introducing 1) auditability, 2) transparency, and 3) immutability to the contract's financial transactions. The MHC comprises an online smart contract and an offline traditional legal contract. where the two are immutably linked. Secure peer-to-peer financial transactions, transparency, and cost accounting are automated by the smart contract, and legal issues or disputes are carried out by civil courts. The reliance on established legal processes facilitates an appropriate adoption of smart contracts in traditional contracts.},

It aims to improve upon existing crypto-currency languages, such as Bitcoin Script and Ethereum's EVM, while avoiding some of the problems they face. Simplicity comes with formal denotational semantics defined in Coq, a popular, general purpose software proof assistant. Simplicity also includes operational semantics that are defined with an abstract machine that we call the Bit Machine. The Bit Machine is used as a tool for measuring the computational space and time resources needed to evaluate Simplicity programs. Owing to its Turing incompleteness, Simplicity is amenable to static analysis that can be used to derive upper bounds on the computational resources needed, prior to execution. While Turing incomplete, Simplicity can express any finitary function, which we believe is enough to build useful ``smart contracts'' for blockchain applications.},

Starting from the presumption that new forms of governance are frequently born in crisis, the chapter analyses several responses to the crisis and asks whether they display features of alternative forms of governance. It finds that some features of contractual governance can be found in all response strategies, but that in the end only one, the European Banking Coordinative Initiative, lives up to a full-fledged contractual governance regime.},

  abstract = {Law codes and regulations help organise societies for centuries, and as AI systems gain more autonomy, we question how human-agent systems can operate as peers under the same norms, especially when resources are contended. We posit that agents must be accountable and explainable by referring to which rules justify their decisions. The need for explanations is associated with user acceptance and trust. This paper's contribution is twofold: i) we propose an argumentation-based human-agent architecture to map human regulations into a culture for artificial agents with explainable behaviour. Our architecture leans on the notion of argumentative dialogues and generates explanations from the history of such dialogues; and ii) we validate our architecture with a user study in the context of human-agent path deconfliction. Our results show that explanations provide a significantly higher improvement in human performance when systems are more complex. Consequently, we argue that the criteria defining the need of explanations should also consider the complexity of a system. Qualitative findings show that when rules are more complex, explanations significantly reduce the perception of challenge for humans.},

It is a repository of rules written in LegalRuleML, an XML formalism designed to be a standard for representing the semantic and logical content of legal documents. The rules represent the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the new Regulation that is significantly affecting the digital market in the European Union and beyond. The DAPRECO knowledge base builds upon the Privacy Ontology (PrOnto) (Palmirani et al in Proceedings of the 7th international conference on electronic government and the information systems perspective: technology-enabled innovation for democracy, government and governance, 2018c), which provides a model for the legal concepts involved in the GDPR, by adding a further layer of constraints in the form of if-then rules, referring either to standard first order logic implications or to deontic statements. If-then rules are formalized in reified Input/Output logic (Robaldo and Sun in J Log Comput 7, 2017) and then codified in LegalRuleML. Reified Input/Output logic is an application of standard Input/Output logic for legal reasoning, in which Input/Output logic is combined with the reification-based approach in Hobbs and Gordon (A formal theory of commonsense psychology, how people think people think. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2017). The DAPRECO knowledge base is then a case study for reified Input/Output logic, and it shows that the formalism indeed appears to be a good candidate to effectively formalize, via uniform and simple (flat) representations, complex linguistic/deontic phenomena that may be found in legal texts. To date, the DAPRECO knowledge base is the biggest knowledge base in LegalRuleML and Input/Output logic freely available online (https://github.com/dapreco/daprecokb/blob/master/gdpr/rioKB\_GDPR.xml).},

Henceforth, much research and policy advice has focused on de-veloping model-based scenarios to identify pathways towards achieving corre-sponding decarbonisation targets. In this paper, we complement such model-based analysis (based on IMAGE and Enertile) with insights from socio-technical transition analysis (MLP) to develop socio-technical storylines that plausibly show how low-carbon transitions can be implemented. We take the example of the transition of the German electricity system towards renewable energies, and elaborate two transition pathways which are assumed to achieve an 80\% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050, but differ in terms of lead actors, depth of change and scope of change: the first pathway captures the substitu-tion of technological components (pathway A) and assumes incumbents as lead actors and focuses on radical technological change while leaving other system elements intact; in contrast, pathway B (broader system transformation) postu-lates new entrants as lead actors, which rests on the assumption that trans-formative change occurs in the whole system, i.e. affecting the architecture of the system, technologies but also practises. For both pathways, we focus on how policy makers could govern such transition processes through transforma-tive policy mixes, and compare the requirements of such policy mixes depend-ing on the pathway pursued. We find that multi-dimensional socio-technical change going beyond technological substitution (pathway B) requires much greater emphasis on societal experimentation and a more proactive role for an-ticipatory deliberation processes from the outset. In contrast, shifting gear from a new entrant friendly past trajectory to an incumbent dominated pathway (pathway A) requires active agency from incumbents and is associated with what we have called regime stabilizing instruments which defend core principles of the old regime while simultaneously fulfilling decarbonisation as additional success criteria.},

This book presents the proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Legal Knowledge and Information Systems (JURIX 2015), which took place in Braga, Portugal in December 2015. The book contains 14 full papers, nine short papers and nine posters delivered at the conference. These address a wide range of topics in legal informatics, and fall into three main subject areas: theory and foundations of AI and law, focusing on themes such as argumentation, reasoning, and evidence; technology of AI and law, which presents technological advancements and solutions; and applications of AI and law, describing implementations of AI and law technology in real world systems. The book offers an overview of the ways in which current information technology is relevant to the practice of law, and will be of interest to all those whose work involves legal theory, argumentation and practice.},

However, it turns out that the knowledge representation in logic programming is difficult for lawyers to understand. So, in this paper, we change knowledge representation of rules in the JUF theory in PROLEG so that we reflect lawyers' reasoning using the idea of ``openness'' proposed by a judge who is a main investigator of the JUF theory.},

The largest problem is knowledge representation, which requires the capability of representing statutory rules and the judicial interpretation of those rules. Once a sufficiently rich paradigm for knowledge representation is developed, another major problem appears\textemdash devising a mechanism for systematic construction of legal arguments. We must also confront many other handicaps. For example, extant legal computer systems retrieve "words" without regard to their "meaning." We argue that "meaning" is the important part of words and therefore legal computer systems should work with "concepts" and not just syntax. This article presents an interim account of our ongoing research, and should not be seen as a final report.

  abstract = {Smart contracts are often used to automate the execution of transactions so that the fairness, credibility and traceability can be ensured. Generally, for different trading events, different smart contracts are needed to be developed so as to meet the needs. This may lead to a reduction in efficiency, especially when large-scale transactions occur. In addition, trading contracts have complex life cycle and terms. Developing a smart contract based on the context of a contract is extremely difficult. These characteristics may do harm to the application of smart contracts in e-commerce. To this end, this paper proposes a trading model based on legal contracts using smart contract templates. The model can dynamically construct, store, and invoke smart contracts based on a smart contract template and the context of a trading contract, thereby improving the reusability of smart contracts and reducing the difficulty for use. Third-party information, like logistics information, is used as the triggering condition of smart contracts to enhance the reasonableness of execution. In this paper, the garment acquisition contract is token as an example to describe the construction method of a smart contract template. Finally, combined with the experiment and the life cycle of a legal contract, the validity and rationality of the model is discussed. The comparison with legal trading contracts in performance is also conducted.},

I then turn to AI and how it is being used by lawyers in the practice of law, people and companies who are governed by the law, and government officials who administer the law. A key motivation in writing this article is to provide a realistic, demystified view of AI that is rooted in the actual capabilities of the technology.

Such a contractual obligation, formulated specifically for computer processability, is what this Article terms a 'computable contract.' Computable contracts are not merely theoretical, but instead are increasingly being used in economically significant domains. Certain widely used financial contracts exemplify this model. The emergence of computable contracts has largely been unrecognized in the legal literature. However, computable contracting is not extensible across all, or even most, contracting scenarios. Rather, it is limited to a small subset of contracting scenarios involving standardization, and relative legal and factual certainty.},

Broadly speaking ``machine learning'' refers to computer algorithms that have the ability to ``learn'' or improve in performance over time on some task. In general, machine learning algorithms are designed to detect patterns in data and then apply these patterns going forward to new data in order to automate particular tasks. Outside of law, machine learning techniques have been successfully applied to automate tasks that were once thought to necessitate human intelligence \textemdash{} for example language translation, fraud-detection, driving automobiles, facial recognition, and data-mining.  If performing well, machine learning algorithms can produce automated results that approximate those that would have been made by a similarly situated person.},

In this paper, we explored the blockchain-based mechanism that aims to improve the critical features of traditional Internet services, including autonomous and decentralized processing, smart contractual enforcement of goals, and traceable trustworthiness in tamper-proof transactions. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive review to conceptualize the blockchain-based framework to develop the decentralized protocols for the extensive number of Internet services. This comprehensive survey aims to address blockchain integration to secure Internet services and identify the critical requirements of developing a decentralized trustworthy Internet service. Additionally, we present a case study of the blockchain-based Internet of Things (IoT) for neuro-informatics to illustrate the potential applications of blockchain architectures. Finally, we summarize the trends and challenges of blockchain architectures that benefit a multitude of disciplines across all the Internet service fields of interest.},
